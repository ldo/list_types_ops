# Run this script from within Blender, for example as follows:
#
#     blender -b -P list_types_ops.py
#
# to get a list of all the undocumented UI object classes which can
# be used for customizing the Blender user interface. These have names
# of the form category_class_name where “category” is an uppercase
# category of Blender functionality, “class” is a two-uppercase-letter
# code indicating the class of UI object, and “name” is the lowercase
# identifying name. As of Blender 3.0, the following values for “category”
# have been observed:
#
#     ACTION
#     ANIM
#     ARMATURE
#     ASSET

# while the following values for “class” have been observed:
#
#     HT -- window header
#     MT -- menu
#     OT -- operator
#     PT -- panel
#
# What are they for? The xx_OT_xx objects are operators that perform
# the built-in Blender functions. The others are UI elements that
# provide the following important class methods:
#
#     cls.append(layoutfunc)
#     cls.prepend(layoutfunc)
#     cls.remove(layoutfunc)
#
# where layoutfunc is a function declared as
#
#     def layoutfunc(self, context) :
#        ...
#
# whose purpose is to add new entries to an instance of the specified
# UI element when it is called. The “append” method puts the new
# entry/entries created by the layoutfunc at the end of the element;
# the “prepend” method puts them at the start, and the “remove” method
# removes the layoutfunc, so those entries will no longer be added.
